# Animated-Maze-Solver
An Animated maze solver program that solves randomly generated perfect mazes using A* algorithm.

This is my very first project on github, feedback would be appreciated :D
## Features:
- Generates a random perfect maze using Depth-first search (DFS) algorithm
- User-ajustable Maze sizes
- Solves said maze with A* algorithm
- Visualised solving process
- A* marks the best possible path for the maze
- A performance graph that compares steps vs running times for both the path A* takes and the best possible path
